# Breakout Trading Strategy

## Definition
Enter when price breaks above resistance with volume confirmation.

## Entry Rules
1. Price closes above resistance level
2. Volume > 1.5x average volume
3. RSI > 50 (confirms momentum)
4. Wait for retest if unsure

## Exit Rules
- **Stop Loss:** 2% below breakout level
- **Target 1:** Previous swing high
- **Target 2:** Measured move (height of consolidation)
- **Trailing:** Move SL to breakeven after 3% profit

## Best Conditions
- Market in uptrend (Nifty above 20 DMA)
- Sector showing strength
- Low volatility before breakout (tight range)

## Avoid When
- Market in downtrend
- Breakout on low volume
- After extended rally (exhaustion breakout)
- Near major events (results, RBI policy)

## Timeframes
- Daily chart for swing trades
- 15min/1hr for intraday

## Position Sizing
- Risk per trade: 1-2% of capital
- Calculate quantity based on SL distance

## Example
```
Stock breaks ₹500 resistance
Stop Loss: ₹490 (2% below)
Risk per trade: ₹5000
Quantity: 5000 / (500-490) = 500 shares
Target: ₹530 (6% upside, 3:1 reward)
```

## Common Mistakes
- Chasing extended breakouts
- No volume confirmation
- Too wide stop loss
- FOMO on missed breakouts
